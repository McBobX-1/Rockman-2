# Rockman-2
This is just an updated version of the already existing version of Mega Man 2 Autosplitter which adds support to Mesen 0.9.9 and fixes auto start when playing Rockman 2.

Original script is made by Coltaho. All credits go to him. Script can be found here: https://github.com/Coltaho/Autosplitters/blob/master/MegaMan2/README.md
